OVERVIEW
--------

main.f90: main program

globals.f90: Variables of the main program, except the mixer all
  other subroutines/functions use intent(in)/intent(out) to protect
  these variables, so in some sence this is not global
  The variables are also allocated here.
  IMPORTANT: This also gives a short comment what the variable is !

broyden.f90: Broyden mixer, this is the old DFTB stuff with little
  cleanup

constants.f90: some constants

core_overlap.f90: routines to calculate the core hamiltonian
  (one-electron) and overlap matrix elements (supervectors)

coulomb_hfex.f90: Coulomb and HF exchange supermatrices

coulomb_potential.f90: Coulomb potential (for ZORA and output) from
  analytical expressions.

density.f90: routines for electron density, wavefunctions, primitives

densitymatrix.f90: get density matrix

dft.f90: DFT functionals and various helper routines (density on grid ...)

diagonalizations.f90: this is EWEVGE with a wrapper

hamiltonian.f90: routines to build the hamiltonian from its parts

input.f90: input routines

integration.f90: Becke mesh definitions and helper routines

numerical_differentiation.f90: numerical differentiation with 6-points
  needed for naive ZORA implementation, e.g. dV/dr with V the potential

output.f90: output routines

precision.f90: DFTB precision routine

total_energy.f90: routines to calculate total energy

utilities.f90: misc stuff (factorial etc.)

zora_routines.f90: ZORA routines, contains even the routines for the
  naive implementation, see NAIVE_ZORA for their use
