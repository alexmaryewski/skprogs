# Toolchain file for

# GNU compiler
#
# Notes:
#
#  * Settings here should work out of the box on Ubuntu (tested on 18.4). Other build environments
#    may need some fine tuning.
#
#  * CMake format: Command line options (e.g. compiler flags) space separated, other kind
#    of lists semicolon separated.
#
#  * Variables containing library search paths are empty by default. The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#    environment variable should be set up correctly, so that CMake can find those libraries
#    automatically. If that is not the case, override those variables to add search paths
#    manually
